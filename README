RASH 2.0 BETA

This is the beta version of Rash 2.0: it includes no database upgrades for your current databases, no user database upgrades, no nothing that will exactly work with
your old Rash 1.2.2.  This is being called Rash 2.0 because it is a complete rewrite of the entire system and is quite more elegant than before.

A few things that must be noted; you must have PEAR::DB support on your PHP system or Rash 2.0 will not function.  It utilizes PEAR::DB for database abstraction that
will work on most all databases meaning that you don't have to have MySQL anymore.  If you do not have PEAR::DB, please get your administrator to install it for you.

The file SQL_TABLES will give you the layout of the new database required for rash, everything must be exact.  Please don't convert your current installation into
Rash 2.0 beta unless you want to do some conversion later on to fix it when Rash 2.0 is officially released.

Many problems in Rash 1.2.2 are fixed and everything is much improved.  I will write up a complete page on all the changes and updates when the official version is 
released.  Have fun playing with Rash 2.0 beta!
